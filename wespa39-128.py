#Major parts of the program:
#Inputs:
    #Barcode scanner, connected via USB, keyboard-like input in Line39 or Line128 format.
    # Line39 currently, simply the length
    # Line128 may be a future expansion with the Work Order as the first 4 digits, length as remainder.
    #Laser scanner, COM port, unknown format
    #Config file, located in a sufficiently obscure place (like AppData)
    #Laser offset value, tolerance, and other non-operator settings in Config file
#Outputs:
    #Zebra Printer, connected via USB, uses ZPL II
#GUI:
    #Display info from laser scanner and barcode, refresh laser in realtime:
    #Table Length/Actual Length in Ft + Decimal Inches
    #Order Length/Desired Length in Ft + Decimal Inches
    #"Off by" Length being difference of the two
    #Green/Yellow/Red Tolerance indicator
    #Laser On/Off toggle buttons
    #Clear button to refresh info from inputs (X button on keyboard)
    #Print button toggled by spacebar; disable if measurements not within tolerance
    
    
        
#Libraries:
    #Pyinstaller for compiling to a single exe
    #tkinter for GUI
    #pyserial for COM IO
